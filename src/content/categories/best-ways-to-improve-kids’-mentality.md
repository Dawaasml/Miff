  _______________________________________

  🧠 1. Encourage Curiosity and Critical Thinking

  •	Let children ask “why” and “how” questions freely.

  •	Use real-life examples and let them explore ideas through play, drawing, or small experiments.

  •	Avoid giving ready-made answers all the time — guide them to find answers themselves.

  💬 2. Teach Emotional Intelligence

  •	Help kids name and understand their feelings (happy, sad, angry, scared).

  •	Teach empathy — ask how others might feel in a situation.

  •	Model calmness and respect when resolving conflicts.

  ________________________________________

  📚 3. Build a Growth Mindset

  •	Praise effort, not just success (“You worked hard,” instead of “You’re smart”).

  •	Teach that mistakes are part of learning.

  •	Share your own stories of failure and how you improved.

  🤝 4. Promote Cooperation and Teamwork

  •	Let kids join group games, school clubs, or community clean-ups.

  •	Encourage sharing and taking turns.

  •	Teach them that helping others makes everyone stronger.

  🎨 5. Encourage Creativity and Imagination

  •	Provide art materials, storytelling, and music.

  •	Let them create their own stories, songs, or drawings — even if imperfect.

  •	Celebrate originality more than perfection.

  🌿 6. Connect Them with Nature and Real Life

  •	Let kids experience farming, caring for animals, planting trees, or cleaning the environment.

  •	Such experiences build responsibility, calmness, and awareness of life around them.

  💪 7. Teach Problem-Solving Skills

  •	Encourage them to think of more than one solution before acting.

  •	Introduce them to local heroes, peacebuilders, and innovators.

  🕊️ 9. Create a Peaceful and Supportive Home/School Environment

  📱 10. Limit Negative Media Influence
